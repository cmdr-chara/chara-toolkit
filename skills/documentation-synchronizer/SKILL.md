# Documentation Synchronizer

Keep user and maintainer documentation aligned with implemented behavior without inventing product semantics.

## Trigger boundary

Use this skill when code/config/API/schema/UI/deployment/operations changed and documentation must be mapped and synchronized.

Do not trigger for unrelated marketing copy, invented product behavior, or as a substitute for implementation verification.

## Required inputs

Resolve the implementation diff/change set, authoritative behavior/contracts, audiences, release/version context, repository working tree, generated docs ownership, and protected user work.

For a read-only drift scan, give it the change set, either a Git base ref or explicit files:

```sh
python skills/documentation-synchronizer/scripts/doc_drift_scan.py . --base origin/main --format markdown
python skills/documentation-synchronizer/scripts/doc_drift_scan.py . --files src/api/routes.ts config/app.yaml --format markdown
```

It lists the changed files (deleted ones included) and, for each documentation surface they may affect (API reference, configuration, runbooks, architecture), the files that point to it.

Verify candidate matches against the real change.

## Safety baseline

- Preserve uncommitted work.
- Do not edit generated docs before identifying their source/generator.
- Do not copy stale docs forward merely for consistency.
- Mark unknown behavior and send it back to the implementer instead of inventing an answer.

## Workflow

1. **Extract the contract delta.** Identify what changed for users, developers, operators, APIs, config, schemas, or migrations.
2. **Map surfaces.** Use `references/doc-surface-map.md` to find READMEs, guides, API docs, examples, runbooks, migration notes, comments, schemas, and generated surfaces.
3. **Establish authority/audience.** Decide which source governs each claim.
4. **Update coherently.** Keep terminology, examples, commands, defaults, and migration/release notes aligned.
5. **Cross-check.** Use `references/update-checklist.md` for links, examples, config, versioned claims, and generated-doc handling.
6. **Report.** State changed surfaces, validated examples/links, known gaps, and behavior questions returned to implementation owners.

## Handoffs and interaction boundaries

Behavior ambiguity goes back to the owning implementation specialist. Migration semantics go to `codebase-evolution-controller`, security-sensitive docs to `security-review`, and release-blocking documentation evidence to `verification-and-release`.

## Failure handling

If authoritative behavior cannot be established, do not harmonize conflicting docs by guess. Record the conflict and the owner needed to resolve it.

## Stop conditions

Stop when affected documentation surfaces agree with authoritative behavior and remaining unknowns or generated-doc actions are explicit.
