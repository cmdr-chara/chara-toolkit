# Codex Toolkit workflow catalog

Use these as **conditional orchestration patterns**, not mandatory chains. A step runs only when its trigger is true, and the primary specialist retains authority over its own decision and stopping conditions.

## Routing principles

- Prefer the smallest workflow that covers the user's request.
- Keep one primary specialist at a time. Supporting skills provide evidence, completion discipline, orchestration, or final release judgment.
- Skip `repository-intelligence` when the relevant architecture and blast radius are already known.
- Do not use `unlazy` for trivial work. Use it when the accepted task is substantial enough that incomplete delivery is a realistic failure mode.
- Do not use `verification-and-release` unless there is an integrated candidate whose readiness actually needs judgment.
- A workflow never overrides a specialist's `AWAITING_APPROVAL`, safety restriction, migration boundary, or user constraint.
- When a handoff changes the task class, explicitly pass the evidence and scope that justified the transition.

## Cross-platform destructive-operation safety

This boundary applies **before** any task-specific workflow when a proposed action can remove, overwrite, reset, move, or irreversibly alter files or data. It applies equally to Windows PowerShell/CMD/Git Bash/WSL, macOS, and Linux, and remains in force under Full Access / bypass permissions. Instructions are not OS-enforced protection.

1. **Establish authority separately.** Permission to fix, build, test, refactor, or clean does not authorize broad deletion or destruction of existing work. Stop for specific user approval if scope is not already explicit and bounded.
2. **Verify exact literal targets.** Check the working directory, OS/shell, resolved absolute paths, intended workspace boundary, symlinks/junctions, mounts, globs, environment-variable expansion, and the target listing/diff before execution. No unresolved variables, relative-parent hops, wildcard roots, or interpolated shell strings for destructive targets.
3. **Protect irrecoverable surfaces.** Never recursively target any drive/filesystem/share root, the home/profile directory, a parent of the workspace, the repository root, mount points, backups, unrelated user directories, or .git metadata. Never treat empty/missing path variables as a valid target. Abort if the target changes between preview and execution.
4. **Avoid shell ambiguity.** On Windows do not nest PowerShell → cmd /c → rd/rmdir, and do not use backslash as a PowerShell quote escape. For known in-scope inspection use PowerShell -LiteralPath and -WhatIf rather than interpolated command strings. On macOS/Linux do not assume rm root protection prevents deleting home folders, mounts, or other trees. Do not rely on GNU-only flags on BSD/macOS tools.
5. **Prefer reversible, scoped changes.** Edit files directly, preserve uncommitted work, use throwaway build directories, and inspect with the read-only target preview if deletion is actually needed. Avoid force/recursive operations where a narrower action works. Treat destructive Git, sync-with-delete, scripting deletion APIs, and bulk permission changes as equivalent risks.
6. **Stop on denial or uncertainty.** Do not switch to Python/Node/PowerShell/Bash/another agent to bypass a restriction. Escalate for precise approval or move the operation into an isolated, least-privilege environment; ordinary tool permission prompts cannot substitute for a sandbox.
7. **Report evidence.** State exact authorized paths, inspected preview, what was changed or not changed, and any skipped unsafe cleanup. Do not claim a policy file or lexical hook made unrestricted shell execution safe.

For detailed OS examples, optional command hooks, and non-destructive checks, consult docs/destructive-operations-safety.md in the toolkit repository. The optional scripts/guard-destructive-command.mjs and scripts/preview-delete-target.mjs ship with the package but are not enabled automatically.

## Toolchain preflight

Use when the real task is blocked by an unknown or broken local shell, runtime, package-manager shim, native-command argument boundary, browser capability, or text encoding.

```text
toolchain-preflight → owning specialist
                    → debugging-investigator? (stable invocation now exposes an application failure)
                    → codebase-evolution-controller? (a real version transition is required)
```

Stop using preflight as soon as one supported invocation reaches the actual task. Do not add it to workflows whose documented repository command already succeeds.

## Bug hunt — unknown defects

Use when the user asks to find important bugs that are not already known.

```text
repository-intelligence? → bug-finder
                         → debugging-investigator? (per confirmed candidate needing causal proof)
                         → owning implementation specialist? (when a fix is authorized)
                         → unlazy? (substantial remediation)
                         → verification-and-release? (integrated release candidate)
```

Rules:

- `bug-finder` discovers and proves/retire candidates; it does not call suspicious code a bug without an observable contract violation.
- Hand a confirmed candidate to `debugging-investigator` when the causal chain or minimal explanatory fix remains uncertain.
- Multiple read-only hunt slices may run in parallel after ownership/scope is mapped. Multiple writers require `multi-agent-work-coordinator` and exclusive write scopes.
- A successful bug hunt may end with findings only; code edits are not required unless the user asked for remediation.

## Known bug — diagnose and fix

Use when the user already supplied a concrete wrong behavior but the cause is unknown.

```text
repository-intelligence? → debugging-investigator
                         → owning implementation specialist? (authorized fix)
                         → unlazy? (multi-surface remediation)
                         → verification-and-release?
```

Do not insert `bug-finder`: the symptom is already known.

## Build or change a feature

```text
repository-intelligence? → owning specialist
                         → multi-agent-work-coordinator? (safe parallel decomposition)
                         → unlazy? (substantial accepted scope)
                         → documentation-synchronizer? (public/config/ops behavior changed)
                         → verification-and-release?
```

Typical owning specialists include `production-web-builder`, `flutter-production-builder`, `expo-react-native-builder`, `codebase-evolution-controller`, or another domain workflow available in the environment.

## Improve an existing codebase

Use when the user has not preselected the improvement.

```text
repository-intelligence → codebase-improvement-planner
                        → selected specialist
                        → unlazy? (substantial approved execution)
                        → verification-and-release?
```

The planner chooses **what** improvement is worth doing; once chosen, the specialist owns **how** it is executed.

## Performance hunt

Use for a named slow path or measurable resource problem.

```text
repository-intelligence? → optimize-codebase-performance
                         → debugging-investigator? (unexpected correctness/lifecycle symptom)
                         → owning implementation specialist? (authorized change)
                         → unlazy?
                         → verification-and-release?
```

Do not optimize from intuition alone. Preserve comparable baseline/candidate evidence.

## Review and refactor

```text
repository-intelligence? → review-and-refactor-code
                         → unlazy? (approved multi-slice refactor)
                         → documentation-synchronizer? (contracts/docs changed)
                         → verification-and-release?
```

A defined PR/branch/diff should route here rather than to `bug-finder`.

## Security review

Use when exploitability, authorization, untrusted-input handling, secrets, or another trust boundary is the primary review decision.

```text
repository-intelligence? → security-review
                         → debugging-investigator? (security-related symptom needs causal proof)
                         → owning implementation specialist? (authorized fix)
                         → unlazy? (substantial remediation)
                         → verification-and-release?
```

A normal PR/code-quality review stays with `review-and-refactor-code`. Dependency/version transitions remain owned by `codebase-evolution-controller`.

## TypeScript quality hardening

```text
repository-intelligence? → typescript-quality-enforcer
                         → selected specialist? (architectural finding leaves lint scope)
                         → unlazy? (approved staged remediation)
                         → verification-and-release?
```

Do not disguise migrations, runtime bugs, or structural redesign as lint cleanup.

## Dependency / framework / schema evolution

```text
repository-intelligence? → codebase-evolution-controller
                         → debugging-investigator? (unknown migration failure)
                         → documentation-synchronizer
                         → unlazy? (large approved migration)
                         → verification-and-release
```

Compatibility, rollout, rollback, and removal criteria remain owned by the evolution specialist.

## Product/interface work

Direction first when product behavior/visual intent is unresolved:

```text
product-design-director → production-web-builder | flutter-production-builder | expo-react-native-builder
                       → unlazy?
                       → verification-and-release?
```

Reference reconstruction instead:

```text
screenshot-to-interface → relevant builder? (production integration)
                        → unlazy?
                        → verification-and-release?
```

## Multi-agent execution

`multi-agent-work-coordinator` is an orchestration helper, not a default prefix. Use it only after the work is understood well enough to define exclusive mutable-resource ownership and integration order.

```text
mapped/approved work
        ↓
multi-agent-work-coordinator
        ├─ mission A (exclusive mutable resources)
        ├─ mission B (exclusive mutable resources)
        └─ mission C (read-only or exclusive mutable resources)
        ↓
integration gates
        ↓
unlazy? → verification-and-release?
```

Mission Control may select reader/writer agents for approved missions. The parent task remains responsible for accepting handoffs and integrated verification.

## Completion and release

`unlazy` and `verification-and-release` are deliberately different:

```text
unlazy
= Did we actually finish the accepted task and prove every required deliverable?

verification-and-release
= Is the final integrated candidate safe and sufficiently evidenced to ship?
```

A task can be `COMPLETION: PASS` and still be blocked from release because release-specific evidence, rollout, rollback, platform coverage, or operational controls are missing.
