# Evaluation Suite

**Information checked:** 2026-09-24

This suite tests routing, overlap resolution, complete workflows, resource integrity, volatile package claims, and provenance. It is designed for deterministic structural validation plus model-based execution review.

## Files

- `routing-cases.json` plus `routing-cases-content-provenance.json`: 84 positive and 63 negative trigger cases—four positive and three negative per production skill.
- `overlap-cases.json` plus `overlap-cases-content-provenance.json`: adversarial prompts that require a primary skill or an explicit sequence/handoff rather than accidental multi-skill activation.
- `workflow-scenarios.md` plus `workflow-scenarios-content-provenance.md`: one realistic end-to-end scenario per production skill with inputs, workflow, artifacts, verification, and stop conditions.
- `adversarial-review.md`: self-review findings, corrections, and remaining refresh obligations.
- `package-claim-review.md`: manual protocol for time-sensitive compatibility, maintenance, license, security, cost, and deprecation claims.
- `post-install-routing-smoke.md`: a compact live-client check for all twenty-one production skill routes and the highest-risk overlaps.
- `mission-control-universal.json`: non-code and mixed-artifact Mission Control scenarios covering documents, research, data, and all six portable roles.

The supplemental evaluation files keep the existing historical corpus stable while adding the content-provenance, unlazy, bug-finder, toolchain-preflight, and security-review routes. The structural validator reads the primary and supplemental files as one canonical evaluation set.

## Structural run

From the pack root:

```sh
python scripts/validate_skill_pack.py . --as-of 2026-09-24
```

The validator checks schema/counts, skill/resource existence, local links, frontmatter, line/token proxies, dated references, source URLs, unsafe command strings, Python syntax, vendored anti-slop integrity/provenance, licensing, and obvious long-paragraph duplication.

## Paired live behavior probes

[Behavioral benchmark guide](behavioral-benchmark.md) describes optional live Codex baseline-versus-candidate capture, strict suite/model/runtime comparisons, and offline scoring. The fixture probes cover release, security, refactor approval, write ownership, completion, and browser evidence. CI checks only evaluator mechanics with synthetic events; no real-model improvement is claimed without captured traces and human review.

Run the offline harness test with `node --test scripts/test_evaluate_behavioral_runs.mjs`.

## Model routing run

For every case in the routing case files:

1. Give only the prompt and the catalog metadata (`name`, `description`) to the model/harness.
2. Record selected skill(s), order, and rationale before loading bodies.
3. A positive case passes when the expected skill is selected as primary.
4. A negative case passes when the named skill is not primary and the stated route—or an equivalent no-skill decision—is selected.
5. Treat over-activation as a failure even if the final answer is plausible.
6. When metadata changes, test at least three paraphrased positive prompts, two adjacent negative prompts, and realistic workflow scenarios; do not reuse the description wording as the test prompt.

For the overlap case files, exact incidental helper use is not required, but the owned decision and sequence must match. A skill may be a prerequisite or handoff without becoming co-primary.

## Post-install smoke run

After copying the skills into a Codex installation, run the prompts in `post-install-routing-smoke.md` in fresh tasks. Record the selected primary skill before judging answer quality. This check is intentionally smaller than the full routing suite and exists to catch installation, metadata, or live-router drift.

## Mission Control portability run

For each case in `mission-control-universal.json`, run the prompt in a fresh task when the client supports subagents. Confirm the selected role, read/write authority, owned resources, and returned evidence match the case. These cases are deliberately not limited to repositories. Static validation proves coverage and role contracts, not live dispatch behavior.

If the runtime does not expose named custom roles, record the fallback explicitly and verify that the same mission scope and ownership boundary were preserved without claiming the unavailable role was used.

## Workflow run

Execute each scenario against a representative fixture or real repository. Review the output for:

- evidence pointers rather than unsupported assertions;
- bounded reads/writes and preservation of user work;
- expected output schemas and stop conditions;
- explicit unknowns and calibrated confidence;
- conditional package/platform decisions;
- TypeScript quality findings verified beyond heuristic text matches and remediated without lint laundering;
- provenance hygiene that inspects before mutation, preserves authorization/scope, checks runtime capabilities, and never equates sanitation with human authorship;
- unlazy completion ledgers that keep blocked work visible, preserve specialist approval boundaries, rerun stale high-value checks, and re-measure final quantitative claims;
- bug-finder hunts that derive real invariants, distinguish confirmed/plausible/retired candidates, prove observable contract violations, and disclose material unexamined surfaces;
- toolchain preflights that resolve one supported invocation, avoid unchanged retries, isolate temporary work, and hand application failures back to the owning specialist;
- security reviews that tie findings to reachable trust-boundary failures, keep uncertain exploitability labeled, and avoid replacing general code review;
- feature-level verification by builders and integrated release judgment only by `verification-and-release`;
- no destructive Git/data action or invented command.

## Acceptance thresholds

- 100% structural validation pass.
- 100% positive/negative case presence and valid schemas.
- No high-severity routing error in overlap cases.
- No missing workflow scenario.
- No broken local reference or script.
- No stale dated reference beyond the configured review window without an explicit warning/block.
- No unlicensed copied material or missing adaptation/vendor notice.
- No unconditional platform or package mandate unsupported by repository evidence.
- No anti-slop vendor drift without a matching pinned-revision/provenance update.
- No provenance sanitation claim that overstates the available inspection surface or implies proof of human authorship.
- No unlazy completion claim with open/blocked required gates, stale final-state evidence, or unmeasured exhaustive/count claims.
- No bug-finder confirmation based only on suspicious code, severity intuition, or missing tests without an observable contract violation and deciding evidence.
- No toolchain preflight activated merely because a task uses local tools when the documented command already works.
- No shipped Mission Control role pins a model, provider, service tier, or reasoning effort; role portability must preserve its sandbox and evidence contract.
- Mission Control universal scenarios cover documents, research, data, and mixed artifacts, with all six roles represented and mutating cases carrying explicit owned resources.
