## What is Codex Toolkit?

Codex Toolkit gives Codex a set of focused workflows for common software-engineering jobs.

You do **not** need to learn the skill names or choose one manually. Install the toolkit, then describe what you want in normal language.

For example:

```text
Find important bugs in this repository.
```

```text
Make this API faster and prove the improvement.
```

```text
Upgrade this framework without breaking compatibility.
```

```text
Review this authentication change for security problems.
```

```text
Finish this feature completely and verify it before saying it is done.
```

Codex Toolkit picks the smallest relevant workflow and loads extra guidance only when it is needed.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

You need **Node.js 18+** and Codex.

```sh
npx --yes github:cmdr-chara/codex-toolkit setup
```

That installs:

- **22 Codex skills**
- **6 optional Mission Control agents**
- automatic workflow routing
- automatic updates from published GitHub releases

### 2. Use Codex normally

Just ask for the outcome you want.

```text
Fix this intermittent reconnect bug properly.
```

```text
Inspect this codebase and tell me what is worth improving next.
```

```text
Build this approved web feature and do not stop half-finished.
```

```text
Is this release actually safe to ship?
```

You can still name a skill explicitly when you want to, but you usually do not need to.

## How it works

A **skill** is a focused set of instructions for one kind of job.

Codex Toolkit keeps the process simple:

1. It reads what you asked for.
2. It selects the skill that owns that job.
3. It loads extra references only when they are relevant.
4. It keeps project-specific instructions in control.
5. It hands work to another specialist only when the task actually changes.

This means a simple bug fix stays simple, while a larger migration or release can use more structure when needed.

Your repository's own `AGENTS.md` always takes priority over the toolkit's general guidance.

## Automatic updates

The full setup installs an updater that follows **published GitHub releases**, not unreleased commits on `main`.

Future releases can add skills, improve workflows, and update routing without requiring another manual install.

Check update status:

```sh
npx --yes github:cmdr-chara/codex-toolkit auto-update status
```

Disable automatic updates:

```sh
npx --yes github:cmdr-chara/codex-toolkit auto-update remove
```

The installer does not replace your global Codex `AGENTS.md`. It manages only its own marked section and leaves the rest of your file untouched.

See [Automatic updates](docs/auto-update.md) for Windows, macOS, Linux, custom `CODEX_HOME`, and scheduler details.

## Want only one skill?

Every skill can also be installed independently.

List the available skills:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/cmdr-chara/codex-toolkit --list
```

Install one skill:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/cmdr-chara/codex-toolkit --skill repository-intelligence -g -a codex
```

A single-skill install does not add the toolkit's automatic routing, Mission Control agents, or updater.

## Mission Control

The full setup also includes six optional agents for work that can be split safely.

Mission Control is **model-agnostic**: the roles do not pin a specific GPT model or reasoning level. They inherit your active Codex/runtime configuration, so the same role definitions can work across compatible current and future models.

It is also **resource-agnostic**. The same mission/ownership model can coordinate code, documents, research, datasets, configuration, reports, and other bounded workspace artifacts.

You do not need to configure or call the agents manually. The toolkit can use them when separate pieces of work have clear boundaries and can be checked independently.

<details>
<summary><strong>Mission Control agents</strong></summary>

| Agent | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| `pathfinder-reader` | Fast discovery and narrow fact lookup |
| `patcher-writer` | Tiny isolated reversible changes |
| `investigator-reader` | Debugging, research, tracing, and focused reviews |
| `builder-writer` | Normal bounded implementation across code, tests, docs, config, and workspace artifacts |
| `sentinel-reader` | High-consequence read-only review |
| `architect-writer` | High-consequence cross-cutting implementation |

The parent Codex task remains responsible for decisions, integration, and checking the final result. If a Codex runtime does not expose named custom roles, the same mission-card boundaries can still be used with the parent or an available generic subagent; the toolkit does not pretend that an unavailable role profile was applied.

Check your installed Mission Control bundle:

```sh
npx --yes github:cmdr-chara/codex-toolkit mission-control check
```

The check verifies all six roles, read/write sandbox boundaries, model-agnostic role files, the installed Mission Control skill, and any managed toolkit routing that is present.

## Safety and verification

The toolkit is designed to keep changes evidence-driven and bounded.

Its workflows emphasize:

- preserving existing user work
- avoiding destructive actions without authorization
- measuring performance before claiming improvements
- separating confirmed bugs from theories
- keeping migrations reversible where possible
- verifying important changes before release
- keeping security findings tied to realistic attack paths

The repository also includes structural validation, routing tests, smoke tests, installer tests, release checks, and provenance checks. Optional paired Codex traces can assess narrow real-run behavior without substituting for end-to-end correctness tests.
